        <h3>Strategy</h3>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>Creating this website to showcase my business and sell jewelry</li>
                <li>I am offering my audice a chance to see my jewelry and purchase a piece</li>
                <li>I would like people to be able to purchase necklaces on my site</li>
                <li>I want a simple and clean design (along with great products) to bring people back</li>
            </ul>    
        </p>
    
        <h3>General Site Description</h3>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>Point of sale site</li>
                <li>It will have a gallery of products, a way to purchse products, info about the Willow Designs, and a contact me section</li>
                <li>My most important message is to get my brand across as a desirable and fun way to accessorize</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <h3>Target Audience</h3>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>Primary audience is women ages 14-55</li>
                <li>This is a large group so the younger side is pretty internet-savvy but the older group may not be</li>
                <li>I would assume the younger part of the audience will have smaller screens and the older part will use larger screens</li>
                <li>I might expect someone to visit my site maybe once every 2-3 months and spend at least 5 minutes on the site</li>
            </ul>
